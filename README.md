# MongoDB_TimeSeriesPOC

Proof of concept code that outlines how time series data can be implemented in MongoDB for various sensor data.
With the sample time_series_data and filtering, the program outputted:
```
20
30
40
```
This means that we can specify what sensor and time slot we want to get data for with one query.
